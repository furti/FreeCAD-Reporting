# FreeCAD-Reporting
The Reporting Workbench makes it possible to extract informations out of a FreeCAD document pretty easily. It can be used via Python or via the GUI. A bit like the "Arch Schedule" Tool on steroids ;)

## Motivation

I was working on an personal Architecture Project. After there where a lot of walls, windows, doors etc. in the model, I needed an easy way to get the information out of the model. I was not happy with the arch schedule tool, as I think it is not as flexible as it could be. As I work with SQL (Structured Query Language https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) a lot during work, I decided to give it a try and create a SQL Module for FreeCAD.

## Getting started

A good advice right at the beginning: Apply textures only **after** you finished modelling your geometry. Otherwise it might be easily possible that you break your texture mapping later on and have to do it again.
